/**
 * `SandboxedFileSystem`: the sandbox-enforcing implementation of the
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-fs` Service Definition. It extends `LocalFileSystem` so all
 * text-storage mechanics — resolve, stat, read/stream, list, removal, the
 * atomic write and the read-match-write edit critical section — are the local
 * implementation's, verbatim; this package adds only the per-call POLICY fence
 * on the mutations. Reads pass through untouched: every mode permits reading.
 *
 * The fence is a policy check in TRUSTED code over a MODEL-CONTROLLED path,
 * NOT a kernel boundary — the operations are the seam's own (open, rename),
 * and only the target path is untrusted, so canonicalize-then-contain is the
 * complete answer to this surface. This is containment, not a security
 * boundary; kernel-grade isolation of untrusted CODE stays `ctx.shell`'s job
 * (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-bash-sandbox`). The residual
 * TOCTOU (an ancestor symlink swapped between the containment re-check and the
 * syscall) is narrowed by re-canonicalizing immediately before delegating and
 * is accepted for this threat model.
 *
 * Per-call policy: `read-only` denies every mutation; `workspace-write` allows
 * a mutation only when the target canonicalizes under the policy's workspace
 * root or a platform temp area from the shared `writableRoots` policy;
 * `danger-full-access` delegates unfenced. A denial throws the structured
 * `FS_SANDBOX_DENIED`.
